// inputs onto the seeded DEFAULT profile and flips the onboarding-complete flag.
// Kept out of the widgets so it's testable against an in-memory database.

/// Everything the fast-track can capture. Every field is optional: a skipped
/// step leaves its value null, which the mapping treats as "keep the seeded
/// default". [empty] is the all-skipped case (finish with nothing captured).
