// The resolved layout decisions for one invoice — the seam between *what an
// invoice looks like* and *how it is painted*.
//
// [InvoiceLayout.resolve] turns an [InvoiceDocument] into an [InvoiceLayoutPlan]
// once; both painters (the on-screen preview and the PDF exporter) consume the
// plan and make NO layout decision of their own. Presence (which cells/rows/
// blocks appear), the risky geometry (the recipient quarter width the preview
// used to re-measure per widget), and the chunked payment rows are all decided
// here, so the two outputs cannot drift.
//
// Pure Dart — imports nothing from Flutter or the `pdf` package. Widths are in
// design pixels (the 820px canvas); the PDF painter multiplies by pdfScale, the
// preview uses them as-is — exactly the existing convention. The plan carries
// only layout decisions; raw data (numbers, labels, formatted money/time) still
// comes from the [InvoiceDocument] the painter also holds.
