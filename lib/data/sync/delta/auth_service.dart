// Phase 5 delta-sync (#294) — account auth + org resolution + adoption.
//
// ACCOUNT-REQUIRED (decision 2026-07-23, superseding the earlier anon-first
// call): sync is an account-based, paid feature, so this never signs in
// anonymously. No session → sync skips (needs sign-in); it never mints an anon
// identity or stamps a throwaway anon org onto local rows. That anon stamping
// was a latent footgun — it forced cross-org re-homes and left orphaned server
// rows — so it's gone. A signed-in account's session persists (supabase_flutter
// storage) and silent-refreshes across restarts.
//
// Auth slice 1 (#310) adds email sign-in + sign-out. Two email methods, two
// horizons:
//   • Password (signUp/signInWithPassword): the path used NOW for personal
//     testing. With Supabase "Confirm email" OFF it sends NO email — a direct
//     API call, no SMTP, no deep-link plumbing, identical on Linux and Android.
//   • OTP code (sendEmailOtp/verifyEmailOtp): the passwordless path for the
//     eventual PUBLIC launch. Dormant until SMTP is configured (deferred).
//
// Signing into a different account replaces the session; identity state is
// cleared on every account change so the org/cursor cache stays honest, and
// resolveOrgAndAdopt then claims all local rows for the signed-in account. To
// carry data onto a shared account across devices, sign into the same account
// (or Export/Import).
