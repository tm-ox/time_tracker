/// The pure decision at the heart of the GUI's live-refresh (PRD #270, slice

/// connection commits, and is stable across the connection's own writes — so it
/// is a writer-agnostic "someone else changed the file" signal (the CLI now, a
/// second CLI, or PowerSync applying remote changes later). This class owns only
/// the last-seen bookkeeping; the timer/lifecycle/drift wiring is a thin shell
/// around it (see the ExternalChangeWatcher widget), keeping the decision
/// Flutter-free and exhaustively testable.

  /// The first observation only establishes the baseline and returns `false`
  /// (no spurious refresh on startup). Every later observation returns `true`
  /// exactly once per NEW value — a repeated (unchanged) value returns `false`,
  /// so idle polls and the app's own writes never trigger a refresh.
